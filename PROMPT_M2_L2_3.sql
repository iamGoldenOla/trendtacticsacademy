    UPDATE lessons SET content = '<div class="lesson-content"><h2>Chain-of-Thought Prompting</h2><h3>Teaching AI to Think Step-by-Step</h3><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is one of the most powerful techniques in prompt engineering. It dramatically improves AI performance on complex reasoning tasks by encouraging step-by-step thinking. This lesson teaches you how to use CoT effectively.</p><h3>What Is Chain-of-Thought Prompting?</h3><p>Chain-of-Thought prompting: Asks AI to show its reasoning process. Breaks complex problems into steps. Makes thinking explicit and visible. Improves accuracy on reasoning tasks. Helps identify errors in logic.</p><h3>Why It Works</h3><p>AI performs better when it: Processes information sequentially. Builds on previous steps. Makes intermediate calculations visible. Catches its own errors. Follows logical progressions.</p><p>Without CoT: AI jumps to conclusions. Skips important steps. Makes hidden assumptions. Produces less accurate results.</p><p>With CoT: AI shows its work. Reasoning is transparent. Errors are visible. Results are more reliable.</p><h3>Basic Chain-of-Thought</h3><h4>Without CoT</h4><p>Prompt: "If a store has 15 apples and sells 60% of them, then receives a shipment of 24 more apples, how many apples does it have?" AI response: "21 apples" (may be wrong, no reasoning shown)</p><h4>With CoT</h4><p>Prompt: "If a store has 15 apples and sells 60% of them, then receives a shipment of 24 more apples, how many apples does it have? Let''s think step by step." AI response: "Let''s solve this step by step: 1. Starting apples: 15. 2. Sells 60% of 15 = 0.6 × 15 = 9 apples. 3. Remaining after sale: 15 - 9 = 6 apples. 4. Receives shipment: 24 apples. 5. Final total: 6 + 24 = 30 apples. Answer: 30 apples"</p><h3>Types of Chain-of-Thought</h3><h4>1. Zero-Shot CoT</h4><p>Simply add "Let''s think step by step" or "Let''s solve this step by step" to your prompt. No examples needed. Works surprisingly well. Easy to implement.</p><p>Example: "Analyze this business problem. Let''s think step by step."</p><h4>2. Few-Shot CoT</h4><p>Provide examples with reasoning steps. Show the thinking process. AI learns the pattern. More reliable for complex tasks.</p><p>Example: "Problem 1: [example with step-by-step solution]. Problem 2: [example with step-by-step solution]. Now solve: [your problem]"</p><h4>3. Structured CoT</h4><p>Define specific steps to follow. Create a reasoning template. Ensure consistent approach. Good for repetitive tasks.</p><p>Example: "Analyze this using: 1. Identify key facts. 2. List assumptions. 3. Apply relevant principles. 4. Draw conclusions. 5. Verify logic."</p><h3>When to Use Chain-of-Thought</h3><p>CoT is especially effective for: Mathematical problems. Logical reasoning. Multi-step analysis. Complex decision-making. Problem decomposition. Debugging and troubleshooting. Strategic planning.</p><p>Less necessary for: Simple factual questions. Creative writing. Straightforward tasks. Single-step operations.</p><h3>Advanced CoT Techniques</h3><h4>Self-Consistency</h4><p>Generate multiple reasoning paths. Compare different approaches. Choose most common answer. Increases reliability.</p><p>Prompt: "Solve this problem using three different approaches. Show your reasoning for each. Then identify the most reliable answer."</p><h4>Least-to-Most Prompting</h4><p>Break complex problems into simpler sub-problems. Solve easiest parts first. Build up to full solution. Good for very complex tasks.</p><p>Prompt: "Let''s break this into smaller parts: 1. What''s the simplest version of this problem? 2. Solve that first. 3. Add complexity gradually. 4. Build to full solution."</p><h4>Tree of Thoughts</h4><p>Explore multiple reasoning branches. Evaluate each path. Backtrack if needed. Choose best solution.</p><p>Prompt: "Consider multiple approaches: Approach A: [reasoning]. Approach B: [reasoning]. Approach C: [reasoning]. Evaluate each and choose the best."</p><h3>CoT for Different Domains</h3><h4>Business Analysis</h4><p>"Analyze this business decision step by step: 1. Current situation. 2. Options available. 3. Pros and cons of each. 4. Financial implications. 5. Risk assessment. 6. Recommendation."</p><h4>Code Debugging</h4><p>"Debug this code systematically: 1. What should the code do? 2. What is it actually doing? 3. Where does the behavior diverge? 4. What could cause this? 5. How to fix it?"</p><h4>Strategic Planning</h4><p>"Develop a strategy step by step: 1. Define objectives. 2. Analyze current state. 3. Identify gaps. 4. Brainstorm solutions. 5. Evaluate options. 6. Create action plan."</p><h3>Optimizing Chain-of-Thought</h3><h4>Be Explicit About Steps</h4><p>Weak: "Think about this carefully" - Strong: "Let''s analyze this step by step: First... Then... Finally..."</p><h4>Number the Steps</h4><p>Makes reasoning clearer. Easier to follow. Helps AI stay organized. Enables verification.</p><h4>Ask for Verification</h4><p>"After solving, verify your answer by checking each step."</p><h4>Request Explanations</h4><p>"Explain your reasoning at each step."</p><h3>Common Mistakes</h3><h4>Mistake 1: Too Vague</h4><p>Weak: "Think about this" - Better: "Let''s solve this step by step"</p><h4>Mistake 2: Skipping Verification</h4><p>Problem: Not checking the reasoning. Solution: Ask AI to verify its own work.</p><h4>Mistake 3: Wrong Granularity</h4><p>Too coarse: Steps too large, skips important details. Too fine: Steps too small, gets lost in minutiae. Right: Appropriate level for the task complexity.</p><h3>Combining CoT with Other Techniques</h3><h4>CoT + Few-Shot Learning</h4><p>Show examples with step-by-step reasoning. AI learns both the pattern and the thinking process.</p><h4>CoT + Role Assignment</h4><p>"You are an expert analyst. Analyze this problem step by step using industry best practices."</p><h4>CoT + Output Formatting</h4><p>"Provide your step-by-step analysis in this format: Step 1: [analysis]. Step 2: [analysis]. Conclusion: [summary]."</p><h3>Measuring CoT Effectiveness</h3><p>Compare results: With CoT vs without CoT. Check accuracy improvements. Evaluate reasoning quality. Test on multiple examples. Refine approach based on results.</p><h3>Practical Applications</h3><h4>Customer Support</h4><p>"Diagnose this customer issue step by step: 1. What is the reported problem? 2. What are possible causes? 3. What troubleshooting steps should we try? 4. What''s the recommended solution?"</p><h4>Content Strategy</h4><p>"Develop a content strategy step by step: 1. Define target audience. 2. Identify their needs. 3. Map content topics. 4. Plan distribution channels. 5. Set success metrics."</p><h4>Technical Writing</h4><p>"Explain this technical concept step by step: 1. High-level overview. 2. Key components. 3. How they interact. 4. Practical examples. 5. Common pitfalls."</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Chain-of-Thought prompting <strong>improves reasoning</strong> by making thinking explicit</li><li>Simple trigger: <strong>"Let''s think step by step"</strong></li><li>Types: <strong>zero-shot CoT, few-shot CoT, structured CoT</strong></li><li>Best for: <strong>math, logic, analysis, complex decisions, problem decomposition</strong></li><li>Advanced: <strong>self-consistency, least-to-most, tree of thoughts</strong></li><li>Optimize by: <strong>being explicit, numbering steps, requesting verification</strong></li><li>Combine with: <strong>few-shot learning, role assignment, output formatting</strong></li></ul><p>In the next lesson, we''ll explore Few-Shot Learning—teaching AI through examples.</p></div>'

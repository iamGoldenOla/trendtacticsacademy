## 📊 **Production Strategy**

Given the scope (10 lessons × 1,400 words = 14,000+ words), I recommend:

### **Option A: Prioritize by Module (Recommended)**
1. Complete Module 1 (Lessons 3-4) - **IMMEDIATE**
2. Complete Module 2 (Lessons 5-8) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
3. Complete Module 3 (Lessons 12-13) - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
4. Complete Module 4 (Lessons 16-17) - **LOWER PRIORITY**

**Rationale:** Students need foundational lessons (1-4) before they can understand advanced concepts. Module 2 teaches core techniques that 80% of users will use daily.

### **Option B: Create Outlines First**
1. I create detailed outlines (500 words each) for all 10 lessons
2. You review and approve
3. I expand approved outlines into full lessons (1,400+ words each)

**Rationale:** Ensures we're aligned on content before I invest time in full lessons.

### **Option C: Full Sprint (All 10 Lessons)**
1. I create all 10 lessons in sequence
2. Estimated time: 4-5 hours
3. You receive complete course in one delivery

**Rationale:** Fastest path to a complete course, but requires significant uninterrupted time.

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Go with Option A** - Complete Module 1 NOW (Lessons 3-4), then assess.

**Why?**
- Students can start learning immediately with a complete foundational module
- You can test the course structure and get student feedback
- We can adjust Modules 2-4 based on real user data
- Reduces risk of creating content that doesn't match student needs

**Next Steps:**
1. I'll create Lessons 3 & 4 (complete Module 1) - **30 minutes**
2. You deploy and test with early students
3. Based on feedback, we prioritize Modules 2-4

## ⏱️ **Timeline Estimate**

| Task | Time | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Lessons 3-4 (Module 1) | 30 min | ⏳ NEXT |
| Lessons 5-8 (Module 2) | 90 min | Pending |
| Lessons 12-13 (Module 3) | 45 min | Pending |
| Lessons 16-17 (Module 4) | 60 min | Pending |
| **TOTAL** | **3.75 hours** | **35% done** |

---

**What would you like me to do?**
- A) Create Lessons 3-4 now (complete Module 1)
- B) Create outlines for all 10 remaining lessons
- C) Full sprint - all 10 lessons in sequence

  "lesson_number": 6,
  "lesson_title": "Introduction to AI-First IDEs: Cursor, Windsurf, and Qoder",
  "introduction": "Having explored Full-Stack Builders that generate complete applications, we now move to a more powerful category of tools: AI-First IDEs. These are professional development environments enhanced with AI capabilities that give you full control while dramatically accelerating your workflow.\n\nAI-First IDEs represent the sweet spot for many developers and ambitious Vibe Coders. They offer the power to build complex, production-grade applications while AI assists with the tedious parts - writing boilerplate, suggesting implementations, explaining unfamiliar code, and debugging issues. Unlike Full-Stack Builders, you work directly with code, but AI makes that work significantly more productive.\n\nThis lesson introduces the three leading AI-First IDEs: Cursor, Windsurf, and Qoder. By the end, you will understand their distinct approaches to AI-assisted development and know which might be best for your needs.",
  "big_idea": "AI-First IDEs are code editors built from the ground up with AI integration. They understand your entire codebase, can make multi-file changes, explain complex code, and assist with debugging. Unlike traditional IDEs with AI plugins, these tools treat AI as a core feature, not an afterthought. The result is a fundamentally different coding experience where AI is always available and deeply integrated.",
  "why_it_matters": "As you progress beyond prototypes to building real products, you need more control than Full-Stack Builders provide. You need to debug issues, optimize performance, integrate with existing systems, and implement custom logic. AI-First IDEs give you this control while keeping AI's productivity benefits. They represent the future of professional software development - understanding them now prepares you for the evolving industry.",

  "when_to_use_ai_first_ides": [
    "You need to work with existing codebases",

  ],
  "real_world_example": "Consider a real scenario: You are building a SaaS application and need to implement Stripe payment integration.\n\nWith a Full-Stack Builder: You describe 'add Stripe payments' and get generated code. If it does not work or needs customization, you are stuck without understanding why.\n\nWith an AI-First IDE (Cursor): You open your existing project. You ask Cursor: 'How should I structure Stripe integration in this codebase?' It analyzes your project and suggests an approach. You then say: 'Create the payment processing module with subscription management.' Cursor generates code that fits your existing patterns. When Stripe's webhook does not work, you ask: 'Why is this webhook failing?' and Cursor helps you debug by analyzing the code and error logs.\n\nThe difference: You maintain understanding and control while AI accelerates every step.",

  "introduction": "Bolt.new has emerged as one of the most powerful Full-Stack AI Builders available today. In this hands-on lesson, you will learn to use Bolt effectively - from crafting your first prompt to deploying a working application. This is where theory becomes practice.\n\nWhat makes Bolt special is its speed and simplicity. You can go from a blank page to a deployed web application in under 30 minutes, often faster. But speed without quality produces disposable prototypes. This lesson teaches you to use Bolt strategically - knowing when to use it, how to prompt it effectively, and how to iterate towards production-quality results.\n\nBy the end of this lesson, you will have built and deployed your first real application using Bolt. You will understand the prompting patterns that produce the best results, and you will know the limitations that help you decide when Bolt is the right tool versus when you need something more powerful.",
  "big_idea": "Bolt.new transforms natural language descriptions into complete, deployed web applications. Your effectiveness depends on prompt quality - specific, structured prompts with clear requirements produce dramatically better results than vague descriptions. The key is learning to think like a product manager: defining what users need, how they will interact with it, and what success looks like.",
  "why_it_matters": "The ability to rapidly prototype and deploy ideas changes what is possible. Instead of spending weeks or months building a minimum viable product, you can test concepts in hours. This accelerates learning, reduces risk, and democratizes entrepreneurship. Mastering Bolt means you can validate business ideas faster, create tools for your personal workflow, and build portfolio pieces that demonstrate real capability.",
  "bolt_fundamentals": {
    "what_bolt_does": "Bolt.new is an AI-powered full-stack application generator. You describe what you want to build in natural language, and Bolt generates a complete working application including frontend UI, backend logic, database schema, and deployment configuration. It uses modern web technologies like React, Node.js, and various databases.",

    "good_prompt_example": "Build a recipe management web app for home cooks. Core features: add recipes with title, ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, and photo upload. Browse recipes in a card grid layout. Search by recipe name or ingredient. Filter by categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert). Save favorites. Modern, warm design with earthy colors. Mobile-friendly. Store data in browser local storage - no backend needed."
  },
  "real_world_example": "Let us build a practical application step-by-step.\n\nProject: Personal Task Tracker\n\nStep 1 - Initial Prompt: 'Build a personal task tracker. Features: add tasks with title and due date, mark tasks complete, filter by status (all, active, completed), delete tasks. Clean, minimal design with a blue accent color. Store tasks in local storage.'\n\nStep 2 - Review and Iterate: The first version appears. The design is good but tasks need priority levels. Refinement: 'Add a priority field to tasks (low, medium, high). Show priority with colored badges. Sort tasks by priority by default.'\n\nStep 3 - Polish: 'Make the add-task form slide down when clicking the Add button. Add a subtle animation when tasks are marked complete. Show a friendly empty state when no tasks exist.'\n\nStep 4 - Deploy: Click deploy, get a live URL, share with others.\n\nTotal time: 15-25 minutes. Result: A fully functional, well-designed task tracker that works on any device.",

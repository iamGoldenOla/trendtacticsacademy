      "title": "Applications of Prompt Engineering",
      "content": "Prompt engineering applies across various domains including content creation, code generation, data analysis, creative writing, research assistance, and problem-solving across industries."
    }
  ],
  "real_world_example": "A marketing professional uses prompt engineering to generate social media content. Instead of a vague prompt like 'Write a Facebook post,' they craft 'Write a 150-word Facebook post in a casual, friendly tone promoting our new eco-friendly coffee cups to environmentally conscious millennials, including a call-to-action.' This specific prompt generates much more targeted content that aligns with their marketing goals.",
  "steps": [
    "Define the purpose of your prompt",
    "Identify the desired output format",
    "Specify the tone and style requirements",
    "Include relevant context and constraints",
    "Test and refine based on results"
  ],
  "playground_activity": "Try writing three different prompts for the same task - one vague, one moderately specific, and one highly detailed. Compare the outputs from an AI tool like ChatGPT to see how specificity affects the results.",
  "reflection_question": "How might prompt engineering skills change the way you approach problem-solving or content creation in your field?",

  "introduction": "Welcome to \"Why Vibe Coding Exists\" in the Vibe Coding course! In this lesson, we'll explore this important concept in a beginner-friendly way. Remember, there's no need to feel anxious - we'll take this step by step with plenty of guidance and support.",
  "big_idea": "Vibe Coding exists because traditional coding approaches often overwhelm beginners with complex syntax and technical rules before they understand the core concepts. Vibe Coding flips this approach by focusing on ideas and creativity first, making digital creation accessible to everyone.",
  "visuals": "Create a comparison diagram showing two paths: one with a person looking overwhelmed by complex code symbols, and another with the same person smiling while creating with simple, intuitive tools. Include a bridge showing how Vibe Coding connects these experiences.",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Recognize the challenges beginners face with traditional coding",
    "Step 2: Understand how focusing on ideas first reduces anxiety",
    "Step 3: Learn about the benefits of guided learning approaches",
    "Step 4: See how Vibe Coding addresses these challenges",
    "Step 5: Appreciate the importance of confidence-building in learning"
  ],
  "example": "Think about learning to drive. Would you start by memorizing every technical detail about the engine, transmission, and electronics? No! You start with the basic goal of getting from point A to point B safely. Vibe Coding works the same way - it focuses on your goals and intentions first, then provides the tools to achieve them.",

  "lesson_title": "Building Your Career as a Vibe Coder: Opportunities and Paths Forward",
  "introduction": "Congratulations on reaching the final lesson of this course. You have learned to use Full-Stack Builders, AI-First IDEs, and Agentic Tools. You understand prompting, debugging, production readiness, and staying current. Now it is time to turn these skills into real-world impact.\n\nThis lesson focuses on the career opportunities that Vibe Coding opens up. Whether you want to build your own products, freelance for clients, contribute to a team, or start a company, these skills create new paths that did not exist even two years ago.\n\nThe key insight is that Vibe Coding skills are not just about coding faster - they enable entirely new approaches to building products, serving clients, and creating value. Understanding these opportunities helps you make strategic choices about where to invest your energy next.",
  "big_idea": "Vibe Coding creates three distinct opportunity paths: building products (creating your own applications and businesses), providing services (helping others build with AI), and contributing to teams (being the AI-powered developer that organizations need). Each path has different requirements and rewards. Understanding all three helps you choose the path that matches your goals.",
  "why_it_matters": "The job market is shifting. Companies increasingly need people who can leverage AI effectively. Entrepreneurs can now build products with tiny teams or alone. Freelancers can deliver faster and at higher quality. Understanding these opportunities positions you to benefit from the shift rather than be displaced by it.",

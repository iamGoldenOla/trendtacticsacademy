  "lesson_title": "The Evolving AI Landscape: Staying Current in a Rapidly Changing Field",
  "introduction": "The Vibe Coding landscape changes faster than any technology field in history. Tools that were cutting-edge six months ago may be obsolete today. New capabilities emerge weekly. This presents both opportunity and challenge.\n\nThis lesson prepares you for continuous learning in this rapidly evolving space. You will develop strategies for staying current, frameworks for evaluating new tools, and principles that remain constant even as specific tools change.\n\nThe goal is not to know every tool - that is impossible. The goal is to build learning habits and evaluation skills that let you quickly adopt valuable new capabilities while avoiding distraction from shiny objects that do not deliver real value.",
  "big_idea": "While specific Vibe Coding tools change rapidly, the underlying principles remain stable: clear intent, systematic testing, iterative refinement, and human oversight. Building strong foundations in principles means you can quickly adapt to any new tool. Developing learning habits and evaluation frameworks matters more than mastering any single tool.",
  "why_it_matters": "Developers who stay current with AI tooling will dramatically outpace those who do not. But chasing every new tool is exhausting and counterproductive. You need a sustainable approach to learning that captures real value while avoiding distraction. This is a career-long skill that compounds over time.",

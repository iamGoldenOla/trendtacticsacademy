    -- LESSON 16: Debugging AI Systems
    UPDATE lessons SET content = '<div class="lesson-content"><h2>Debugging AI Systems</h2><h3>When Things Go Wrong</h3><p>Even with AI assistance, code breaks, features don''t work as expected, and bugs appear. Debugging AI-generated code requires a slightly different approach than debugging code you wrote yourself. This lesson teaches you how to effectively debug AI systems and fix issues quickly.</p><h3>Why AI-Generated Code Breaks</h3><p>Common reasons for bugs in AI code: Misunderstood requirements (AI interpreted your prompt differently than intended). Missing edge cases (AI didn''t consider unusual scenarios). Integration issues (AI-generated code doesn''t fit with existing code). Outdated patterns (AI used deprecated methods or libraries). Logical errors (AI''s reasoning was flawed). Context limitations (AI didn''t have full picture of your system).</p><h3>The AI Debugging Mindset</h3><p>Debugging with AI is different: You didn''t write the code, so you need to understand it first. AI can help debug its own code. You can ask AI to explain what went wrong. The bug might be in your prompt, not the code.</p><h3>Step-by-Step Debugging Process</h3><h4>Step 1: Reproduce the Issue</h4><p>Confirm the bug exists: What exactly is broken? When does it happen? What are the steps to reproduce? What''s the expected vs actual behavior?</p><h4>Step 2: Understand the Code</h4><p>Before fixing, understand what the code does: Ask AI: "Explain what this function does step by step." Read through the logic. Identify the relevant parts.</p><h4>Step 3: Isolate the Problem</h4><p>Narrow down where the bug is: Is it frontend or backend? Which function or component? What data is involved? Add console.logs or breakpoints.</p><h4>Step 4: Diagnose the Cause</h4><p>Ask AI for help: "This function is supposed to [expected behavior] but instead it [actual behavior]. Why might this be happening?"</p><h4>Step 5: Implement the Fix</h4><p>Once you understand the cause: "Fix this bug: [describe the issue and cause]." Review the proposed fix. Test thoroughly.</p><h4>Step 6: Prevent Recurrence</h4><p>Add safeguards: "Add validation to prevent this issue in the future." "Add error handling for this edge case." "Write a test that would have caught this bug."</p><h3>Common AI Code Bugs and Fixes</h3><h4>Bug 1: Null/Undefined Errors</h4><p>Symptom: "Cannot read property of undefined"<br>Cause: AI didn''t check if data exists before using it.<br>Fix: "Add null checks before accessing [property]. Use optional chaining (?.) where appropriate."</p><h4>Bug 2: Infinite Loops or Re-renders</h4><p>Symptom: Page freezes, browser becomes unresponsive.<br>Cause: Missing dependencies in useEffect, incorrect loop conditions.<br>Fix: "This component is re-rendering infinitely. Add proper dependencies to useEffect and add exit conditions to loops."</p><h4>Bug 3: Async/Await Issues</h4><p>Symptom: Data not loading, promises not resolving.<br>Cause: Missing await keywords, improper promise handling.<br>Fix: "This async function isn''t waiting for data. Add await to all async operations and handle errors properly."</p><h4>Bug 4: State Management Problems</h4><p>Symptom: UI not updating, stale data displayed.<br>Cause: Direct state mutation, incorrect state updates.<br>Fix: "State isn''t updating correctly. Use functional updates and avoid mutating state directly."</p><h4>Bug 5: API Errors</h4><p>Symptom: 400/500 errors, failed requests.<br>Cause: Incorrect endpoints, missing headers, bad data format.<br>Fix: "API calls are failing with [error]. Check the endpoint URL, request headers, and data format."</p><h3>Using AI as Your Debugging Partner</h3><h4>Technique 1: Explain the Symptoms</h4><p>"When I click the submit button, nothing happens. The console shows no errors. The form has name and email fields. What could be wrong?"</p><h4>Technique 2: Share Error Messages</h4><p>"I''m getting this error: [paste full error message]. Here''s the relevant code: [paste code]. What''s causing this and how do I fix it?"</p><h4>Technique 3: Describe Expected vs Actual</h4><p>"This function should return the sum of all numbers in the array, but it''s returning NaN. Here''s the function: [paste code]. What''s wrong?"</p><h4>Technique 4: Ask for Step-by-Step Analysis</h4><p>"Walk me through what this code does line by line, and identify where the bug might be."</p><h3>Advanced Debugging Techniques</h3><h4>Console Logging Strategy</h4><p>Ask AI to add strategic logs: "Add console.logs to track: Input values at function start. Intermediate calculations. API request/response. Final return value."</p><h4>Breakpoint Debugging</h4><p>"Where should I set breakpoints to debug this issue? What variables should I inspect at each breakpoint?"</p><h4>Network Debugging</h4><p>"The API call isn''t working. Help me debug by checking: Request URL and method. Request headers and body. Response status and data. CORS settings."</p><h4>State Debugging</h4><p>"Add logging to track state changes in this component. Show: Initial state. What triggers updates. New state after each update."</p><h3>Debugging Different Layers</h3><h4>Frontend Debugging</h4><p>UI not displaying correctly: "Inspect the component tree and identify which component isn''t rendering. Check props being passed." Events not firing: "Add event listeners logging to confirm events are triggering. Check event handler bindings."</p><h4>Backend Debugging</h4><p>API endpoints failing: "Test the endpoint with curl/Postman. Check server logs for errors. Verify database connections." Database queries not working: "Log the actual SQL being executed. Check for syntax errors. Verify table/column names."</p><h4>Integration Debugging</h4><p>Frontend and backend not communicating: "Check CORS settings. Verify API URLs match. Confirm request/response formats. Check authentication headers."</p><h3>Preventing Bugs with AI</h3><h4>Request Defensive Code</h4><p>"Write this function with: Input validation. Error handling. Null checks. Type checking (if using TypeScript)."</p><h4>Ask for Edge Case Handling</h4><p>"What edge cases should this function handle? Add code to handle: Empty inputs. Invalid data types. Extreme values. Network failures."</p><h4>Generate Tests</h4><p>"Write tests for this function covering: Normal cases. Edge cases. Error conditions. Boundary values."</p><h3>When AI Can''t Fix the Bug</h3><p>Sometimes AI struggles with complex bugs: The bug requires deep domain knowledge. The issue is in external dependencies. The problem is environmental (not in code). The bug is intermittent and hard to reproduce.</p><p>In these cases: Break the problem down smaller. Provide more context about your system. Try a different AI tool. Search for similar issues online. Ask in developer communities.</p><h3>Debugging Checklist</h3><p>Before asking AI for help: ☐ Can you reproduce the bug consistently? ☐ Do you have the full error message? ☐ Have you identified which part of the code is involved? ☐ Do you understand what the code is supposed to do? ☐ Have you checked for typos and simple mistakes? ☐ Have you reviewed recent changes?</p><h3>Common Debugging Mistakes</h3><p><strong>Mistake 1: Fixing Symptoms, Not Causes</strong><br>Don''t just make the error go away—understand why it happened.</p><p><strong>Mistake 2: Making Multiple Changes at Once</strong><br>Change one thing at a time so you know what fixed it.</p><p><strong>Mistake 3: Not Testing the Fix</strong><br>Always verify the fix works and doesn''t break anything else.</p><p><strong>Mistake 4: Not Learning from Bugs</strong><br>Understand the root cause to avoid similar bugs in the future.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>AI-generated code breaks for <strong>specific reasons</strong>: misunderstood requirements, missing edge cases, integration issues</li><li>Follow a <strong>systematic debugging process</strong>: reproduce, understand, isolate, diagnose, fix, prevent</li><li>Use AI as your <strong>debugging partner</strong> by explaining symptoms and sharing errors</li><li>Add <strong>defensive code</strong> to prevent bugs: validation, error handling, null checks</li><li><strong>Test thoroughly</strong> after fixes to ensure nothing else broke</li><li>Learn from each bug to <strong>improve your prompts</strong> and prevent similar issues</li></ul><p>In the next lesson, we''ll apply everything you''ve learned to build a complete SaaS application with AI.</p></div>'

Flexible: Content stored as JSON allows rich formatting. Trackable: Progress tables enable detailed analytics. Scalable: Proper indexing and relationships support growth.</p><h3>Building the Course Player</h3><h4>The Challenge</h4><p>Create an engaging learning experience that: Displays rich content (text, images, code, videos). Tracks progress automatically. Provides smooth navigation. Works on mobile and desktop. Loads quickly.</p><h4>The Solution (Built with AI)</h4><p>Prompt used: "Create a course player component with: Sidebar showing course structure (modules and lessons). Main content area with rich text rendering. Progress tracking (mark lessons complete). Next/Previous lesson navigation. Responsive design (sidebar collapses on mobile). Video player integration. Code syntax highlighting. Quiz integration."</p><h4>Iterations Made</h4><p>Iteration 1: Basic layout and navigation.<br>Iteration 2: Added progress tracking.<br>Iteration 3: Improved mobile experience.<br>Iteration 4: Added keyboard shortcuts.<br>Iteration 5: Optimized loading performance.</p><h3>Interactive Features</h3><h4>AI Playground</h4><p>One of the unique features is the AI coding playground embedded in lessons.</p><p>Prompt: "Create an AI-powered code playground where: Users can write code in a textarea.

Explanation for correct answers. Progress saving. Retry functionality. Different question types (single choice, multiple choice, true/false)."</p><h3>Progress Tracking System</h3><h4>The Requirements</h4><p>Track: Which lessons students have completed. Time spent on each lesson. Overall course progress percentage. Last accessed lesson. Completion dates.</p><h4>Implementation with AI</h4><p>Prompt: "Implement progress tracking: When user opens a lesson, record last_accessed. When user marks lesson complete, update lesson_progress. Calculate overall course progress as (completed_lessons / total_lessons). Show progress bar in UI. Store all progress in Supabase. Handle edge cases (reopening completed lessons, skipping ahead)."</p><h3>Authentication and User Management</h3><h4>Auth Flow</h4><p>Prompt: "Set up authentication with Supabase: Email/password signup and login. Email verification. Password reset flow. Protected routes (redirect to login). User profile page. Role-based access (student, instructor, admin). Session management with JWT."</p><h4>User Dashboard</h4><p>Prompt: "Create a student dashboard showing: Enrolled courses with progress. Continue learning (resume last lesson). Achievements and certificates. Account settings. Clean, motivating design."</p><h3>Content Management</h3><h4>Admin Interface</h4><p>Prompt: "Build an admin panel for instructors: Create/edit/delete courses. Add modules and lessons. Upload videos and images. Reorder content with drag-and-drop. Publish/unpublish courses. View student analytics. Rich text editor for lesson content."</p><h4>Rich Content Rendering</h4><p>Prompt: "Create a content renderer that supports: Markdown formatting. Code blocks with syntax highlighting. Embedded videos. Images with captions. Callout boxes (tips, warnings, notes). Interactive elements (quizzes, playgrounds). LaTeX math equations (if needed)."</p><h3>Performance Optimization</h3><h4>Challenges Faced</h4><p>Initial version was slow because: Loading all course data at once. No image optimization. Large JavaScript bundles. Slow database queries.</p><h4>Optimizations Made</h4><p>Prompt: "Optimize the LMS performance: Implement pagination for lesson lists. Lazy load lesson content. Optimize images with Next.js Image component. Add database indexes on user_id, course_id, lesson_id. Implement caching for course structure. Use React.memo for expensive components. Code split by route."</p><p>Result: Page load time reduced from 3s to under 1s.</p><h3>Mobile Experience</h3><h4>Mobile-First Approach</h4><p>Prompt: "Make the LMS fully responsive: Sidebar becomes bottom navigation on mobile. Content optimized for small screens. Touch-friendly buttons (44px minimum). Swipe gestures for next/previous lesson. Offline support for downloaded lessons. Reduced data usage on mobile networks."</p><h3>Real-World Challenges and Solutions</h3><h4>Challenge 1: Video Hosting</h4><p>Problem: Hosting videos is expensive and complex.<br>Solution: Used YouTube/Vimeo for hosting, embedded players in lessons. Prompt: "Integrate YouTube videos with: Responsive embed. Track watch progress. Resume from last position. Playlist support."</p><h4>Challenge 2: Content Security</h4><p>Problem: Need to protect paid content from unauthorized access.<br>Solution: Implemented row-level security in Supabase.

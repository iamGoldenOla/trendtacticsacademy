  "introduction": "In this lesson, we'll explore advanced prompting techniques that encourage AI systems to think through problems step-by-step. Chain of thought prompting is a powerful technique that improves the accuracy and reliability of AI responses by encouraging the system to explain its reasoning process. This approach is particularly effective for complex problem-solving tasks.",
  "big_idea": "Encouraging AI systems to show their reasoning process leads to more accurate, explainable, and reliable responses.",
  "why_it_matters": "Chain of thought prompting helps the AI break down complex problems into manageable steps, leading to more accurate solutions and providing insights into how the AI arrived at its conclusions. This transparency is valuable for verifying results and understanding the AI's logic.",

  "real_world_example": "Instead of asking 'What's the answer to this math problem: 15% of 240?', you could use chain of thought: 'Calculate 15% of 240. First, explain how to calculate percentages. Then show the calculation step-by-step. Finally, provide the answer.' This approach ensures the AI demonstrates its reasoning and makes it easier to verify the calculation.",
  "steps": [
    "Break the problem into logical steps",
    "Ask the AI to explain its reasoning",
    "Request intermediate calculations or thoughts",
    "Verify each step of the process",
    "Synthesize the final answer"
  ],
  "playground_activity": "Take a complex problem (mathematical, analytical, or logical) and ask it two ways: 1) Directly for the answer, and 2) Using chain of thought prompting. Compare the accuracy and explainability of the responses.",
  "reflection_question": "How does requiring step-by-step reasoning change the quality and trustworthiness of AI responses?",
  "quiz": {
    "question": "What is the primary benefit of chain of thought prompting?",
    "options": [
      "It makes the AI respond faster",
      "It encourages the AI to think through problems step-by-step, often leading to more accurate answers",
      "It reduces the cost of using AI",
      "It makes the AI more creative"
    ],
    "answer": "It encourages the AI to think through problems step-by-step, often leading to more accurate answers",
    "explanation": "Chain of thought prompting encourages systematic thinking and often results in more accurate answers, especially for complex reasoning tasks."

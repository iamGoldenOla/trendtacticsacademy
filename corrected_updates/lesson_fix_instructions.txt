LESSON CONTENT REPETITION FIX INSTRUCTIONS

To fix the lesson content repetition issue:

1. FIRST: Make sure your database has the proper lesson content
   - Check that lessons in the 'lessons' table have unique content
   - If lessons are just placeholders with titles like "Setting up your development environment", they need real content

2. RUN the AI content generation:
   - The vibe-coding-course.json file contains comprehensive lesson content
   - You need to run the lesson population script to add this content to your database

3. If lessons still show repetition, run this SQL to check your lessons:
   
   -- Check for lessons in the Vibe Coding course
   SELECT l.id, l.title, l.content, m.title as module_title 
   FROM lessons l
   JOIN modules m ON l.module_id = m.id
   JOIN courses c ON m.course_id = c.id
   WHERE c.title ILIKE '%Vibe Coding%'
   ORDER BY m.ordering, l.ordering;

4. If lessons have NULL or empty content, you need to populate them using the data in vibe-coding-course.json

5. Make sure your lesson-viewer.html is properly configured to display the content from the database, not from static placeholders.

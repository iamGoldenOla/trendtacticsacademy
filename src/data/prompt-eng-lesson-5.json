  "lesson_title": "Context Layering",
  "introduction": "Context layering is the strategic placement and organization of information within a prompt to maximize its effectiveness. In this lesson, we'll explore how to structure context at different levels to guide AI behavior without overwhelming the system with unnecessary information. Effective context layering creates prompts that are both comprehensive and efficient.\n\nAI models have limited context windows, so how you layer and prioritize information significantly impacts the results. The most important information should be placed where the AI is most likely to attend to it, while supporting context should be organized to enhance rather than dilute the core instructions.\n\nWe'll examine different types of context, understand how to layer them effectively, and learn to balance comprehensive instructions with processing limitations. This skill is essential for creating prompts that work reliably in complex, real-world scenarios.",
  "big_idea": "Context layering involves strategically organizing information within prompts at different levels: global context (broad instructions), local context (task-specific details), and persistent vs temporary instructions. The placement of information affects how AI processes and prioritizes it. Effective context layering ensures critical instructions receive attention while supporting information enhances rather than dilutes the core message.",
  "why_it_matters": "Context layering matters because AI models have limited processing capacity and attend to information differently based on its position and organization. Poorly layered context can result in important instructions being ignored or diluted by excessive background information.\n\nIn professional settings, well-layered prompts produce consistent results that meet requirements while avoiding the common problem of 'context dumping' - where too much information actually reduces effectiveness. Understanding context layering allows you to create prompts that work reliably within AI processing limitations.\n\nAdvanced prompt engineering requires understanding how to prioritize information, place critical instructions where they'll receive attention, and structure supporting context to enhance rather than compete with core instructions.",

    {
      "title": "Global Context vs Local Context",
      "content": "Global context includes broad instructions, role definitions, and general constraints that apply throughout the interaction. This context sets the overall framework for how the AI should approach tasks and remains relevant regardless of specific task details.\n\nLocal context includes task-specific details, immediate requirements, and specific parameters that apply to the current request. This context provides the specific information needed to complete the immediate task.\n\nEffective prompts layer these contexts appropriately, with global context establishing the framework and local context providing specific details. The challenge is balancing comprehensive global instructions with focused local details without creating confusion or exceeding processing limits."
    },
    {
      "title": "Persistent vs Temporary Instructions",
      "content": "Persistent instructions are those that should apply across multiple interactions or remain in effect for extended periods. These often include role definitions, brand guidelines, and behavioral constraints.\n\nTemporary instructions apply only to the current task or interaction. These include specific task requirements, immediate constraints, and contextual details that are relevant only for the current request.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction helps you structure prompts that maintain important long-term guidelines while adapting to specific task requirements. It's especially important in multi-turn conversations or when using AI systems for ongoing projects."
    },
    {
      "title": "Why Dumping Context Reduces Quality",
      "content": "Context dumping occurs when excessive background information is included without proper organization or prioritization. This can overwhelm the AI's processing capacity, dilute important instructions, and lead to inconsistent results.\n\nAI models have limited context windows and may not process all information equally. When too much context is provided without clear prioritization, critical instructions may receive less attention than supporting details.\n\nEffective context layering provides sufficient information for the AI to understand requirements while avoiding information overload that reduces effectiveness. Quality matters more than quantity in context provision."
    },
    {
      "title": "Positional Impact on Processing",
      "content": "The position of information within a prompt affects how the AI processes and prioritizes it. Information at the beginning and end of prompts often receives more attention than information in the middle, especially in longer prompts.\n\nUnderstanding this positional impact helps you place critical instructions where they'll receive maximum attention. Important role definitions and constraints are often placed at the beginning, while important output requirements may be placed near the end.\n\nDifferent AI models may have different sensitivities to positional effects. Learning these patterns for specific models helps you optimize context layering for each system you use."

  "real_world_example": "Consider a content creation system for a company with specific brand guidelines. A poorly structured approach might dump all brand guidelines at the beginning: 'Our company values, brand voice, target audience, competitor analysis, market position, customer demographics, product details, tone requirements, style guide, and formatting rules,' followed by 'Now write a blog post about X.'\n\nA better approach uses context layering: 'You are an experienced content marketer for [Company]. Follow our brand voice: professional but approachable, customer-focused, value-driven (Global Context). Write a 800-word blog post about [Topic] for marketing professionals aged 28-45 (Local Context). Include 3 key takeaways and a call-to-action. Avoid technical jargon (Persistent Instructions). Address the specific challenges of [specific topic details] (Temporary Instructions).'\n\nThis layered approach ensures critical brand guidelines are established while specific task details remain clear and actionable.",

    "Step 1: Identify global context that applies broadly across tasks",
    "Step 2: Determine local context specific to the current task",
    "Step 3: Separate persistent instructions from temporary requirements",
    "Step 4: Organize information with critical instructions at high-attention positions",

  "playground_activity": "Take a complex task you normally ask AI to perform. First, create a prompt by dumping all context at the beginning. Then, create a second prompt using proper context layering with global and local context appropriately placed.

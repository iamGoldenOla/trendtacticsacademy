    "lesson_title": "What is Vibe Coding?",
    "introduction": "Welcome to the future of software development. In this lesson, you will discover Vibe Coding—a revolutionary approach where humans focus on intent, systems, and outcomes while AI handles the execution. This is not about learning to write code the old way. This is about learning to build software the way it's actually done in 2025.",
    "big_idea": "Vibe Coding is the modern paradigm of software development where you describe what you want in plain language, and AI tools translate your intent into working code. Instead of memorizing syntax, you learn to think clearly, communicate effectively with AI, and focus on solving real problems. The term was coined by Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI director) to describe how developers today 'vibe' with AI—describing outcomes and letting AI handle implementation details.",
    "why_it_matters": "Traditional coding required years of learning syntax, debugging cryptic errors, and understanding low-level implementation details. Vibe Coding removes these barriers. Now, anyone with clear thinking and good communication skills can build functional software. This democratizes software creation and makes it accessible to entrepreneurs, designers, marketers, and anyone with an idea worth building.",
    "key_concepts": [
      "Intent-driven development: Focus on what you want, not how to code it",
      "AI as execution partner: AI writes and debugs code based on your descriptions",
      "Outcome-first thinking: Start with the end result and work backward",
      "Iterative refinement: Build, test, improve in rapid cycles",
      "Human-AI collaboration: You provide direction, AI provides implementation"
    ],
    "real_world_example": "Imagine you want to build a simple to-do app. In traditional coding, you would spend weeks learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, then frameworks, then databases. With Vibe Coding, you open a tool like Bolt.new or Lovable, describe 'I want a to-do app where users can add tasks, mark them complete, and delete them,' and within minutes you have a working prototype. You refine it by saying 'make the completed tasks gray and move them to the bottom,' and the AI updates the code instantly.",
    "practical_application": "By the end of this course, you will be able to describe a software idea in plain English and use AI tools to build it into a working application. You will understand which tools to use for different types of projects, how to give effective instructions to AI, and how to iterate on your builds until they match your vision.",

    "introduction": "Now that you understand what Vibe Coding is and why it matters, it's time to explore the tools that make it possible. This lesson provides a comprehensive overview of the Vibe Coding ecosystem—from full-stack AI builders to AI-powered IDEs to autonomous coding agents.",
    "big_idea": "The Vibe Coding ecosystem consists of three main categories of tools: Full-Stack AI Builders (like Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit Agent) that generate complete applications from descriptions; AI-First IDEs (like Cursor, Windsurf, Qoder) that enhance traditional coding with AI assistance; and Agentic Tools (like Devin, Claude Computer Use) that can autonomously complete complex development tasks. Each category serves different use cases, and understanding when to use which tool is a core Vibe Coding skill.",
    "why_it_matters": "Choosing the wrong tool for your project can waste hours or even days. A simple landing page doesn't need an autonomous agent. A complex enterprise system might overwhelm a visual builder. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each tool category, you can make informed decisions that accelerate your development process.",

    "introduction": "Understanding tools is important, but knowing how to use them together in an effective workflow is what separates productive Vibe Coders from those who struggle. This lesson teaches you the AI-First development workflow—a systematic approach to building software with AI tools.",
    "big_idea": "The AI-First development workflow follows a clear pattern: Describe, Generate, Evaluate, Refine, Deploy. You start by describing what you want in plain language, then generate code or an application using AI tools. You evaluate the output against your requirements, refine through iterative prompting, and finally deploy to production. This cycle can happen many times per day, enabling rapid iteration that was impossible with traditional development.",
    "why_it_matters": "Without a structured workflow, Vibe Coding can feel chaotic. You might waste time regenerating the same code, lose track of what you've tried, or get stuck in unproductive loops. The AI-First workflow gives you a repeatable process that consistently produces results. It also helps you communicate with AI more effectively, which is the core skill that determines your success.",

      "Deploy: Push working code to production",
      "Rapid iteration: Complete this cycle multiple times per day"
    ],
    "real_world_example": "Building a customer feedback widget: You DESCRIBE it as 'a floating button that opens a feedback form with star rating and text input.' You GENERATE it in Bolt.new. You EVALUATE and notice the button is too small on mobile. You REFINE by saying 'make the button larger on mobile screens and add a subtle animation.' You GENERATE again and EVALUATE—now it looks great. You DEPLOY to your website. Total time: 20 minutes. Traditional development: 2-3 days.",
    "practical_application": "From this point forward, you will apply this workflow to every project you build in this course. You will practice writing clear descriptions, evaluating AI output critically, and refining through effective prompts. These skills transfer across all Vibe Coding tools and will remain valuable even as specific tools evolve.",

    "introduction": "The quality of your prompts directly determines the quality of AI-generated code. This lesson teaches you specific techniques for writing prompts that produce better, more reliable software.",
    "big_idea": "Prompt engineering for code differs from general prompt engineering. Code prompts need to specify technology stack, handle edge cases, define error handling, and produce consistent output formats. The best prompts are specific, structured, and provide context about the existing codebase. Vague prompts produce vague code; precise prompts produce precise code.",
    "why_it_matters": "Poor prompting is the main reason people get frustrated with AI coding tools. They describe something vaguely, get unexpected results, and conclude the tool doesn't work. With proper prompting techniques, the same tools produce dramatically better results. Prompt engineering is the core skill that separates effective Vibe Coders from struggling ones.",
    "key_concepts": [
      "Specificity: Name technologies, versions, and expected behavior explicitly",
      "Structure: Break complex prompts into clear sections",
      "Context: Provide relevant code, file structure, or domain information",

It should check for @ symbol, valid domain format, and minimum length of 5 characters. If validation fails, return the specific error reason. Include JSDoc comments.'",
    "practical_application": "Take a prompt you've used that didn't work well. Rewrite it using the techniques from this lesson: add specificity, structure it clearly, provide context, include examples, and state constraints. Test both versions and compare results.",

    "introduction": "Building on basic prompt engineering, this lesson covers advanced strategies for complex development scenarios: multi-step prompting, prompt chaining, iterative refinement, and working with large codebases.",
    "big_idea": "Complex projects require complex prompting strategies. Multi-step prompting breaks large tasks into manageable pieces. Prompt chaining connects outputs of one prompt to inputs of another. Iterative refinement improves results through targeted follow-up prompts. Working with large codebases requires techniques for providing relevant context without exceeding token limits.",
    "why_it_matters": "Basic prompting works for simple tasks. But real-world projects involve interdependent components, legacy code integration, and evolving requirements. Advanced strategies let you tackle projects that would be impossible with naive prompting approaches.",
    "key_concepts": [
      "Multi-step prompting: Break large tasks into sequential prompts",
      "Prompt chaining: Use output of one prompt as input to next",

      "Context windowing: Provide relevant context for large codebases",
      "System prompts: Establish persistent context for consistent behavior"
    ],
    "real_world_example": "Building a complex feature: Step 1 prompt generates the data types. Step 2 uses those types to generate the API endpoint. Step 3 uses the API to generate the frontend component. Step 4 generates tests for all layers. Each step is manageable; together they build something complex.",
    "practical_application": "Choose a complex feature you want to build. Before prompting, plan your multi-step approach: What needs to be built first? What depends on what? Write out your prompt chain before executing it.",

  "lesson_title": "Core Prompt Components",
  "introduction": "Every effective prompt follows a structured approach with specific components that guide AI behavior. In this lesson, we'll examine the essential elements that make prompts reliable and effective. Understanding these components allows you to systematically build prompts that produce consistent, high-quality results across different AI models and use cases.\n\nA well-structured prompt is like a well-designed form with clear sections that guide the AI through the task systematically. Each component serves a specific purpose and contributes to the overall effectiveness of the instruction. The order and clarity of these components significantly impact the quality of the output.\n\nWe'll explore each component in detail, understand how they interact, and learn to apply them systematically to create prompts that work reliably in professional settings. This foundation will support all your future prompt engineering efforts.",
  "big_idea": "Effective prompts follow a structured approach with specific components: Role definition, Task definition, Constraints, Output format, Tone & style, and Scope limits. Each component serves a specific function in guiding AI behavior, and systematic use of these components creates reliable, predictable results. Understanding how to combine these elements allows you to build prompts that work consistently across different scenarios.",
  "why_it_matters": "Understanding core prompt components matters because it transforms prompt engineering from trial-and-error to a systematic discipline. When you know which components to include and how to structure them, you can create prompts that work reliably in professional settings, scale across different AI models, and maintain quality standards.\n\nWithout understanding these components, you're essentially guessing at what might work. With this knowledge, you can systematically build prompts that address all the necessary elements for effective AI interaction. This approach is especially important when designing prompts for production systems or when consistency is critical.\n\nProfessional prompt engineers use these components as building blocks to create complex, multi-step instructions that produce reliable results. Understanding these fundamentals allows you to progress to more advanced techniques with confidence.",

    {
      "title": "Role Definition",
      "content": "The role definition establishes who the AI should act as when completing the task. This component tells the AI what expertise, perspective, and approach to bring to the task. A well-defined role provides context for all subsequent instructions and guides the AI's approach to the task.\n\nEffective role definitions are specific and detailed. Instead of 'You are an expert,' use 'You are an experienced financial analyst with 10 years in investment banking.' The more specific the role, the more targeted the AI's response will be.\n\nThe role definition should include relevant expertise, experience level, and perspective. It sets the foundation for how the AI will approach the task and what knowledge it will draw upon."
    },
    {
      "title": "Task Definition",
      "content": "The task definition clearly specifies what the AI should do. This component answers the questions: What exactly should be produced? What are the specific requirements? What are the inputs and expected outputs?\n\nEffective task definitions are explicit about requirements and avoid ambiguity. Instead of 'Write about marketing,' use 'Write a 500-word analysis of digital marketing trends for 2025, focusing on AI integration, privacy changes, and customer personalization.'\n\nThe task definition should include all necessary context, specific requirements, and clear expectations for the output. It serves as the core instruction that the rest of the prompt supports."
    },
    {
      "title": "Constraints and Boundaries",
      "content": "Constraints define what the AI should NOT do or what limitations it must respect. These include content restrictions, format requirements, style limitations, and other boundaries that shape the output.\n\nEffective constraints are explicit about what to avoid. Instead of hoping the AI won't include certain elements, clearly state what to exclude. For example: 'Avoid technical jargon,' 'Do not include pricing information,' or 'Do not make up statistics.'\n\nConstraints prevent the AI from extrapolating beyond intended boundaries and ensure the output meets specific requirements. They're especially important when the output will be used in professional or public contexts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Output Format Specification",
      "content": "The output format defines exactly how the result should be structured. This includes document structure, formatting requirements, organization, and any technical specifications for the output.\n\nClear format specifications ensure consistency and make outputs suitable for integration with other systems. Instead of 'Write a report,' specify 'Write a report with Executive Summary, Key Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion sections.'\n\nFormat specifications save time on post-processing and ensure outputs meet integration requirements. They're essential when outputs need to follow specific standards or be processed by other systems."
    }
  ],
  "real_world_example": "Consider a company that needs to generate product descriptions. A poorly structured prompt might be: 'Write a product description.' This produces inconsistent results with varying length, tone, and format.\n\nA well-structured prompt using core components: 'You are an experienced e-commerce copywriter with expertise in consumer electronics (Role). Write a product description for our new wireless headphones (Task). Include key features, target audience, and benefits. Keep it under 200 words. Use a professional but approachable tone. Avoid technical jargon that non-technical customers won't understand (Constraints). Format as: Product name, Key features list, Target audience, Benefits, Call to action (Output Format).'\n\nThis structured approach produces consistent, on-brand product descriptions that meet all requirements every time.",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Define the specific role or persona for the AI to assume",
    "Step 2: Clearly specify the exact task with all requirements",
    "Step 3: Set explicit constraints and boundaries for the output",
    "Step 4: Define the precise output format needed",
    "Step 5: Specify tone, style, and other relevant parameters",
    "Step 6: Test the prompt to ensure all components work together effectively"

  "playground_activity": "Take a simple task you frequently ask AI to perform. Write a prompt using only the task definition. Then write the same prompt using all four core components (Role, Task, Constraints, Output Format).

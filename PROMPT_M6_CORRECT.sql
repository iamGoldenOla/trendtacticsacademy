-- LESSON 1: Common Prompt Engineering Mistakes (ID: f1334fe9-24c4-4da0-bc80-dc3e252e543b)
UPDATE lessons SET content = '<div class="lesson-content"><h2>Common Prompt Engineering Mistakes</h2><h3>Learning from Common Pitfalls</h3><p>Even experienced prompt engineers make mistakes. Learning to recognize and avoid common pitfalls saves time and improves results. This lesson covers the most frequent mistakes and how to avoid them.</p><h3>Mistake 1: Being Too Vague</h3><p>Problem: Prompts lack specificity and detail. Example: Write something about marketing. Why it fails: AI does not know what type of content, for whom, what length, what angle. Solution: Be specific. Write a 500-word blog post about email marketing best practices for small business owners. Include 3 specific tactics and examples.</p><h3>Mistake 2: Assuming AI Knows Context</h3><p>Problem: Not providing necessary background information. Example: Analyze this data (without explaining what the data is). Why it fails: AI lacks context about domain, purpose, audience. Solution: Provide context. This is sales data from our e-commerce store for Q4 2023. Analyze trends, identify top products, and suggest improvements for Q1 2024.</p><h3>Mistake 3: Overcomplicating Prompts</h3><p>Problem: Prompts are too long, complex, or confusing. Example: 500-word prompt with multiple conflicting requirements. Why it fails: AI gets confused, important details get lost, results are inconsistent. Solution: Simplify. Break complex tasks into steps. Use clear structure. Remove unnecessary information.</p><h3>Mistake 4: Not Providing Examples</h3><p>Problem: Expecting AI to understand format without examples. Example: Create a product description (without showing what format you want). Why it fails: AI guesses format, may not match your needs. Solution: Use few-shot learning. Provide 2-3 examples of desired output format and style.</p><h3>Mistake 5: Ignoring Output Format</h3><p>Problem: Not specifying how output should be structured. Example: Give me information about X (unstructured request). Why it fails: AI chooses arbitrary format, may not be usable. Solution: Specify format. Provide as bullet points with headings or Format as JSON with these fields or Use this template.</p><h3>Mistake 6: Not Testing Variations</h3><p>Problem: Using first prompt without iteration. Example: Running one prompt and accepting whatever output comes. Why it fails: First attempt rarely optimal, missing better approaches. Solution: Test multiple variations. Try different phrasings, temperatures, approaches. Compare results.</p><h3>Mistake 7: Trusting AI Blindly</h3><p>Problem: Not verifying AI outputs for accuracy. Example: Publishing AI-generated content without fact-checking. Why it fails: AI can hallucinate facts, make errors, produce outdated information. Solution: Always verify. Check facts, validate logic, review for accuracy. Human oversight essential.</p><h3>Mistake 8: Wrong Temperature Setting</h3><p>Problem: Using inappropriate temperature for task. Example: High temperature for factual extraction, low temperature for creative writing. Why it fails: Temperature affects consistency and creativity. Solution: Match temperature to task. Low (0-0.3) for factual, medium (0.5-0.7) for general, high (0.8+) for creative.</p><h3>Mistake 9: Inconsistent Instructions</h3><p>Problem: Contradictory or conflicting requirements. Example: Be comprehensive but keep it under 100 words. Why it fails: AI cannot satisfy conflicting constraints. Solution: Ensure consistency. Review for conflicts. Prioritize requirements clearly.</p><h3>Mistake 10: Not Using Chain-of-Thought</h3><p>Problem: Expecting complex reasoning without showing steps. Example: Solve this complex problem (without asking for step-by-step). Why it fails: AI may skip steps, make errors in reasoning. Solution: Add Let us think step by step or Show your reasoning for each step.</p><h3>Mistake 11: Ignoring Token Limits</h3><p>Problem: Exceeding context window with too much information. Example: Pasting entire documents into prompts. Why it fails: Information gets truncated, important details lost. Solution: Summarize. Provide only relevant information. Use chunking for large content.</p><h3>Mistake 12: Poor Constraint Definition</h3><p>Problem: Vague or unmeasurable constraints. Example: Make it professional or Keep it short. Why it fails: AI interprets subjectively, results vary. Solution: Define precisely. Use formal tone, third person, no jargon or Exactly 300 words, 3 paragraphs.</p><h3>Mistake 13: Not Iterating</h3><p>Problem: Accepting first output without refinement. Example: Using initial draft as final version. Why it fails: Quality improves with iteration. Solution: Use iterative refinement. Generate, critique, refine, repeat until satisfactory.</p><h3>Mistake 14: Forgetting Edge Cases</h3><p>Problem: Not handling unusual inputs or scenarios. Example: Code that works for normal cases but breaks on edge cases. Why it fails: Production systems encounter edge cases. Solution: Explicitly request edge case handling. Test with unusual inputs.</p><h3>Mistake 15: No Quality Validation</h3><p>Problem: Not checking output quality systematically. Example: No review process before using AI outputs. Why it fails: Quality varies, errors slip through. Solution: Implement validation. Check against criteria. Use review processes.</p><h3>Mistake 16: Ignoring Cost</h3><p>Problem: Not considering API costs. Example: Generating same content repeatedly, using expensive models unnecessarily. Why it fails: Costs accumulate quickly. Solution: Optimize for cost. Cache results. Use appropriate models. Monitor spending.</p><h3>Mistake 17: Not Documenting</h3><p>Problem: Not saving effective prompts. Example: Recreating prompts from scratch each time. Why it fails: Waste time, lose improvements. Solution: Build prompt library. Document what works. Version control prompts.</p><h3>Mistake 18: Wrong Model Selection</h3><p>Problem: Using inappropriate model for task. Example: Using most expensive model for simple tasks. Why it fails: Unnecessary cost, may not improve quality. Solution: Match model to task. Test different models. Use cheaper models when sufficient.</p><h3>Avoiding Mistakes</h3><p>Prevention strategies: Start with clear requirements. Provide context and examples. Test and iterate. Validate outputs. Document learnings. Learn from failures. Build on successes. Continuous improvement.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Common mistakes: vague prompts, missing context, no examples, wrong temperature</li><li>Always verify AI outputs - never trust blindly</li><li>Provide specific format requirements and examples</li><li>Use appropriate temperature for task type</li><li>Iterate and refine rather than accepting first output</li><li>Handle edge cases explicitly</li><li>Document effective prompts for reuse</li><li>Match model and parameters to task requirements</li></ul><p>In the next lesson, we will explore Testing and Validating Prompts systematically.</p></div>'

UPDATE lessons SET content = '<div class="lesson-content"><h2>Testing and Validating Prompts</h2><h3>Ensuring Quality and Reliability</h3><p>Testing prompts systematically ensures consistent quality and reliability. This lesson teaches you how to test and validate prompts effectively before deployment.</p><h3>Why Test Prompts?</h3><p>Testing is essential because: AI outputs vary, edge cases exist, quality must be consistent, errors are costly, production requires reliability. Systematic testing catches issues early.</p><h3>Types of Testing</h3><p>Test at multiple levels: Unit testing (individual prompts), integration testing (prompt chains), regression testing (after changes), performance testing (speed and cost), user acceptance testing (real users). Comprehensive testing ensures quality.</p><h3>Unit Testing Prompts</h3><p>Test individual prompts thoroughly. Test aspects: Functionality (does it work), quality (is output good), consistency (reliable results), edge cases (handles variations), format compliance (correct structure). Example: Test prompt with 10 different inputs, verify all outputs meet requirements.</p><h3>Test Case Design</h3><p>Create comprehensive test cases. Include: Normal cases (typical inputs), edge cases (boundary conditions), error cases (invalid inputs), variation cases (different phrasings), stress cases (extreme inputs). Cover the range of possibilities.</p><h3>Quality Criteria</h3><p>Define measurable quality standards. Criteria: Accuracy (factually correct), completeness (all requirements met), relevance (on-topic), format (correct structure), tone (appropriate style), constraints (rules followed). Clear criteria enable objective evaluation.</p><h3>Automated Testing</h3><p>Automate where possible. Automated checks: Format validation (JSON, structure), length requirements (word count), keyword presence (required terms), constraint compliance (rules followed), consistency (multiple runs). Automation scales testing.</p><h3>Manual Review</h3><p>Human review for quality. Review for: Accuracy and truthfulness, clarity and readability, tone and appropriateness, nuance and context, overall quality. Humans catch what automation misses.</p><h3>Consistency Testing</h3><p>Test output consistency. Method: Run same prompt multiple times, compare outputs, measure variation, identify inconsistencies. Goal: Understand and control variability. Use lower temperature for more consistency.</p><h3>Edge Case Testing</h3><p>Test boundary conditions. Edge cases: Empty inputs, very long inputs, special characters, unusual formats, extreme values, missing information. Systems fail at edges - test them.</p><h3>Performance Testing</h3><p>Measure speed and cost. Test: Response time (latency), throughput (requests per second), token usage (cost), resource consumption. Optimize based on measurements.</p><h3>A/B Testing</h3><p>Compare different approaches. Test: Different prompts, different models, different parameters, different techniques. Measure: Quality, speed, cost, user satisfaction. Data-driven optimization.</p><h3>Regression Testing</h3><p>Test after changes. When updating prompts: Run previous test cases, verify no degradation, check new functionality, compare to baseline. Ensure changes improve, not harm.</p><h3>User Acceptance Testing</h3><p>Test with real users. UAT process: Select representative users, provide test scenarios, collect feedback, measure satisfaction, identify issues. Real users reveal real problems.</p><h3>Test Documentation</h3><p>Document testing thoroughly. Document: Test cases and scenarios, expected results, actual results, pass/fail criteria, issues found, fixes applied. Documentation enables improvement.</p><h3>Validation Checklist</h3><p>Systematic validation process: Check accuracy and facts, verify completeness, validate format, test edge cases, measure consistency, review quality, assess performance, get user feedback. Comprehensive validation.</p><h3>Common Testing Mistakes</h3><p>Avoid testing pitfalls: Testing only happy path (missing edge cases), not testing enough variations, no baseline for comparison, ignoring performance, skipping user testing, not documenting results. Thorough testing prevents problems.</p><h3>Building Test Suites</h3><p>Create reusable test suites. Test suite components: Standard test cases, edge case scenarios, performance benchmarks, quality criteria, validation scripts. Reusable suites save time.</p><h3>Continuous Testing</h3><p>Test continuously, not once. Ongoing testing: After prompt changes, with new models, periodically in production, when issues reported. Continuous testing maintains quality.</p><h3>Key Takeaways</h3><ul><li>Systematic testing ensures prompt quality and reliability</li><li>Test types: unit, integration, regression, performance, user acceptance</li><li>Create comprehensive test cases including edge cases</li><li>Define measurable quality criteria</li><li>Combine automated testing with manual review</li><li>Test consistency by running prompts multiple times</li><li>Use A/B testing to compare approaches</li><li>Document testing thoroughly and test continuously</li></ul><p>In the final lesson, we will explore Final Projects and Advanced Strategy.</p></div>'

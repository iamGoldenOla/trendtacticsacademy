  "lesson_title": "Understanding Agentic AI: Devin, OpenHands, and Autonomous Development",
  "introduction": "We have now reached the cutting edge of Vibe Coding: Agentic AI tools. These are not assistants that wait for your instructions - they are autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and iterate on development tasks with minimal human guidance.\n\nAgentic coding represents a fundamental shift in how software gets built. Instead of prompting for each step, you describe an outcome and the agent figures out how to achieve it. It can browse documentation, write code, run tests, debug errors, and refine its approach - all autonomously. This is the future that many predicted but few expected to arrive so quickly.\n\nIn this lesson, you will understand what agentic AI is, explore the leading tools (Devin and OpenHands), and learn when autonomous development is appropriate versus when human guidance is essential.",
  "big_idea": "Agentic AI tools are autonomous software development agents that can independently plan, execute, and iterate on complex tasks. Unlike assistants that respond to prompts, agents take high-level goals and work towards them independently, asking for human input only when truly necessary. This represents the highest level of AI delegation in Vibe Coding, requiring clear specifications but offering transformative productivity gains.",
  "why_it_matters": "Agentic AI is transforming software development economics. Tasks that previously required hours of developer time can be delegated entirely, freeing humans to focus on higher-level decisions. However, effective delegation requires understanding what agents can and cannot do, how to specify tasks clearly, and when human oversight is essential. Mastering this balance is a valuable skill as agentic tools become more prevalent.",

    "Step 1: Evaluate whether your task is well-suited for agentic development",

  "playground_activity": "While full agentic tools may not be immediately accessible, you can practice the specification skill. Write a detailed specification for this task: 'Build a URL shortener service.' Include: core features, technical requirements, constraints, edge cases to handle, and success criteria. Compare your specification to a classmate's or review it critically - what ambiguities might cause an agent to produce wrong results?",

  "summary": "In this lesson, you explored agentic AI - autonomous agents that can plan and execute complex development tasks independently. You learned the difference between assistants and agents, explored Devin and OpenHands, and understood when agentic development is appropriate.

In the next lesson, we will focus on real-world workflows that combine different Vibe Coding tools for maximum effectiveness."

                "description": "<h3><b>The Shift from Syntax to Intent</b></h3><p>Vibe Coding is the practice of turning human intent into executable systems using AI. Unlike traditional coding—where syntax is king—Vibe Coding treats clarity, structure, and judgment as the core skills.</p><h3><b>Why Syntax-First Learning Collapses</b></h3><p>In the past, 80% of lines written were boilerplate. In 2026, AI handles this instantly. Learning syntax first is like learning to spell every word in the dictionary before writing an essay. It is slow and outdated.</p><h3><b>Orchestration Beats Implementation</b></h3><p>The new developer is a Conductor. You don't play every instrument; you ensure they play <i>together</i>. Your job is to define the 'Vibe' (the architecture, user experience, and constraints) and let the AI agents handle the 'Notes' (functions, variable names, style).</p><h3><b>Cost Curve of Software</b></h3><p>AI reduces the cost of producing code to near-zero. This means the <i>volume</i> of code will explode. The bottleneck shifts from 'Writing' to 'Reviewing' and 'Integrating'.</p><h3><b>Key Takeaways</b></h3><ul><li><b>Intent > Syntax:</b> If you can describe it, you can build it.</li><li><b>Reviewer Mindset:</b> You are now Editor-in-Chief.</li><li><b>Speed:</b> Experimentation is now free.</li></ul><h3><b>Tools Referenced</b></h3><p>Using: ChatGPT, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.0, Cursor, Antigravity.</p>",

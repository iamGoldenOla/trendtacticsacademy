  "lesson_title": "Zero-Shot and Self-Consistency Techniques",
  "introduction": "In this lesson, we'll explore zero-shot prompting and self-consistency techniques. Zero-shot prompting involves getting AI to perform tasks without providing examples, relying solely on clear instructions and context. Self-consistency techniques involve generating multiple responses and selecting the most consistent or highest quality one. These advanced techniques can significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of AI outputs.",
  "big_idea": "Advanced prompting techniques like zero-shot and self-consistency can improve the reliability and accuracy of AI responses.",
  "why_it_matters": "Zero-shot prompting allows you to get quality results without having to provide examples, making the process more efficient. Self-consistency techniques help ensure the accuracy of AI responses by comparing multiple outputs and selecting the most consistent one.",

    {
      "title": "Zero-Shot Prompting",
      "content": "This technique involves getting the AI to perform a task without providing examples, relying entirely on clear instructions, context, and role definition. The AI applies its pre-trained knowledge to the task."
    },
    {
      "title": "Self-Consistency Methods",
      "content": "Generating multiple responses to the same prompt and comparing them to identify the most consistent or accurate answer. This is particularly useful for tasks requiring factual accuracy."
    },
    {
      "title": "Instruction Clarity",
      "content": "For zero-shot prompting to be effective, instructions must be extremely clear, comprehensive, and unambiguous. The AI has no examples to reference, so instructions must be self-contained."
    }
  ],
  "real_world_example": "For zero-shot prompting: 'You are an expert financial analyst. Analyze the implications of a 2% increase in interest rates on small business loans. Consider cash flow, expansion plans, and investment decisions. Format your response as a 3-point analysis with specific recommendations.' For self-consistency: Running the same prompt 3-5 times and comparing responses to find the most consistent facts or recommendations.",
  "steps": [
    "For zero-shot: Ensure instructions are comprehensive and clear",
    "Provide sufficient context for the AI to understand the task",
    "Define the role or expertise level required",
    "Specify the desired output format",
    "For self-consistency: Generate multiple responses",
    "Compare responses to identify consistent elements",
    "Select the most accurate or consistent answer"
  ],
  "playground_activity": "Try a complex analytical task using zero-shot prompting (no examples). Then try the same task with few-shot prompting (with examples). Compare the results and note when each technique is more effective.",
  "reflection_question": "When might zero-shot prompting be more appropriate than few-shot prompting?",
  "quiz": {
    "question": "What is zero-shot prompting?",
    "options": [
      "Prompting without providing examples",
      "Prompting with many examples",
      "Prompting that makes the AI respond quickly",
      "Prompting that reduces AI creativity"

  "key_takeaways": [
    "Zero-shot prompting works without examples",
    "Self-consistency improves accuracy by comparing multiple responses",
    "Clear instructions are crucial for zero-shot success",
    "These techniques expand your prompt engineering toolkit"
